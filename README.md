RobustPCA method for agnostic estimation of mean for Gaussians and distributions with bounded fourth moments. The code accompanies the paper "Agnostic Estimation of Mean and Covariance"  at FOCS 2016.

This repository contains code for computing the mean of a distribution in the presence of adversarial noise. The code is written in Matlab.

The main routine is
